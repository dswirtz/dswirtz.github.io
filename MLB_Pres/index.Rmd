## MLB Application

The MLB application was built with intention to explore the MLB team history from 1973 to 2014.

The application can be found at [https://dswirtz.shinyapps.io/MLB_App/](https://dswirtz.shinyapps.io/MLB_App/).

The features of the application are as follows:
* A slider that allows the user to filter which years are shown in the dataset
* A series of checkboxes that allows the user to filter which teams are shown in the dataset
* A legend that has the extended names for the variables in the dataset
* An interactive datatable that allows the user to search, ascend, and descend variables
* An interactive chart that allows the user to visualize a comparison between two variables
* Information tab that includes details of the application

## Data

The data used for this application was found on [statcrunch.com](http://www.statcrunch.com).
The dataset, [MLB Team Histories (1973-2014)](http://www.statcrunch.com/5.0/index.php?dataid=1819295) was modified to remove redundancies and fix inaccuracies in some stats. The modified version of the dataset can be found on [github](https://github.com/dswirtz/DevelopingDataProducts). Dimensions and features of the data frame are below.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("MLB Team History (1973-2014).csv", check.names = FALSE)
dim(data); colnames(data)
```

## Data Table Example
